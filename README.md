# Netlify-Lambda-Github

A small test application that showcases how serverless apps can be developed. React is used as frontend application. The lambda functions can be found in the folder: `src/lambda`.

## Getting Started

Run `npm install` in the root directory.

Copy the `example.env` file in config and rename it to `.env`. Change values where applicable.

Next, run `npm run start` to start local development. This starts both the frontend and lambda functions. See the `package.json` file for more specific scripts.

### Prerequisites

- Node v8.9.4+

## Deployment

Deployment is done via Netlify.
